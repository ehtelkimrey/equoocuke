                            <p>The first player of Filipino ancestry to play in MLB was Bobby Balcena whose career spanned 7 games for the Cincinnati Reds in 1956. He was born in San Pedro, California. Yeah, that probably sounds strange, but hear me out. Keep in mind I haven't owned a sports game since NBA Jam TE 15(?) years ago. In RPGs, you usually have a group of people/characters that have a particular job, and if everyone does their job correctly, you'll win the fight. This basketball game is no different at all, and if you and your team do well, you get points to spend on your character to "level up". The amount of detail that goes into leveling up your character is light-years beyon. Anyone have this game (it rocks) egtting my ass handed to me on My Player Season mode - trying to trade players as well but having some trouble. Any tips would be awesome. I've been doing the dribbling drill all day trying to get +2 to speed but I can't seem to get it; or a +2 to anything else for that matter. Is there something specific I need to do to get a +2 or is it completely random? I've been doing it over and over for hours and getting gold every time. I can get a +1 to speed, but I haven't gotten a +2 to anything  I dunno.probably by practicing basketball instead of playing video games. 
This might be unpopular among a lot of people on this sub, but let's see. I have played NBA 2K since 2K11. The golden age of NBA 2K. I also played primarily on PC and used mods to make the game look better - those mods included player faces, arenas, dornas and huge overhauling rosters. Therefore I'm used to being fairly offline player, both in MyLeague and in MyCareer. I also love the game of basketball.

Here are mine: 2K10: This was my first 2K game when I was just getting into basketball. After getting myCareer player sent to the D-League a billion times, I finally managed.

Only well-formatted and professional-style feedback is forwarded. Make sure your suggestions are clear and easy to understand My name is J. Yi (not gonna put my full first name for privacy), and since NBA 2K11, the commentators have always called me "Jianlian", like the Chinese player that was drafted 6th to the Bucks in 2007. The commentators have never called me by my correct name in the last 8 years of NBA 2K, and it's super annoying. How am I going to live out my fantasy of averaging a triple double and scoring 50+ a night in the NBA when the commentators won't even call me by my real name but instead I'm not a baseball guy. Of regularly televised sports, I'd rank baseball as fourth or fifth behind hockey, football (American football), and soccer (football for everyone else). Depending upon my mood and how much of a bandwagon I've hopped on, it could also rank below basketball. Generally, I don't pay any attention to the sport until around my birthday, which leaves me with a little over a month of the season to watch. I keep tabs by consistently asking friends I know pay attention I just played 2k19 after coming back all the way from 2k11. Don’t care about online so I will omit it. I will mostly talk about the gameplay. Going into the menu, I see nothing special. Ok, it works but no 2k I have played did anything special in that department(except 2k10 which sucked). I decide to fire up a quick match just to take a quick look at the gameplay. I noticed inmediately the sheer number of classic teams! I chose the modern day Bucks against the 2000-2001 Sixers with Iverson. 
I've watched Smoove since 2K11. Rather it was Call Of Duty, 2K, or a single player game I've always gotten a kick out of Smoove content amp commentary. These days it feels like he just does enough to pay the bills. He rarely creates his own content. He grabs NBA hightlights and puts commentary over those. He hasn't criticized 2K much if at all this year and out of nowhere he has GO Giannis for My Team. Maybe he's just burned out on 2K I don't know. Smoove blocking foul/pushing animations still in game, refs and rec center refs still dont call them fouls, its as if 2k devs feel these animations are totally legit defensive animations, and not blatant fouls amp#x200B; finishing still sucks, hip riding/blocking foul animations are magnets to slashers amp#x200B; never calls reach in fouls, even when the defender blatantly reaches across the entire body amp#x200B; dunking is a joke, toddlers on a 3 foot rim dunk and finish with more ferocit.

If something you commented last time was not selected to be forwarded The biggest disappointment this year for me and my squad was Pro-Am. It's the one thing we enjoyed playing and 2K ruined it this year, without notice! This isn't the 2K league, this isn't real basketball. I'm sorry, but not everyone is playing this game like their life depends on it. We have a couple of people that play with us but we have a main 3-4 that play almost every day. We don't wanna be forced to pick up some randoms for our team just to fill the spots. There was no issue Got the next 2k20 here is my idea/concept/wishlist. The way I will be doing this is combining what 2k did good in the past to make a great game in the future. Ok to start Graphics up date the graphic and player models but have the lighting like it was for 2k14 because it made the game look amazing Bring back the 2k12, 2k11, and I know it’s not 2k but also add the NBA live 05 game moves also those games have the best game modes put all of those in one game it would be amazing Xbox Gamer Tag: WH1TExCHOCOLATE Name: Josh Humphries “2K Yall messed up, yall really messed up on this one.” Those words and that video more than likely haunt Choc’s dreams. Before we get to that though, let’s start with a little background on the most infamous NBA 2K player and NBA 2K League Prospect, WH1TExCHOCOLATE. Choc’s real name is Josh Humphries, and his home state is Florida. Seems like all the best 2K Players are from Florida, but I may be biased. Choc has been playing 
Tldr; We have got to remember this is a basketball game after all. The LARGE majority of players voted for somewhere in-between real basketball simulation and cartoony over the top. That's definitely not what we got though. Like I said idk what the solution is here but this is ridiculous. It's like a little kids games. amp#x200B; Listen i've played park since it was introduced in 2k11 (online blacktop with match making). I know it's park and it's always been cheesy but this is completel. My dad years ago started playing NBA 2K11 now he's playing on 2K18 he don't play 2K19 cause he heard people say it sucked. But, i like to share the controls my dad used in those NBA Games, and it is weird though. Controls: WASD: Move F5: Sprint 6: Shoot 8: Block 5: The B and O Button (I dunno) Space: Change Player/Character/Pass. Hi all, Used to be a big fan of the NBA 2K games. Mostly played singleplayer. Last game I was able to play before life got in the way was 2K11/12 or maybe 2K10, just when those VC points made an appearance. With that being said, do you recommend me getting 2K19? I will be only playing singleplayer. I see many complaints about the VC points. What happens with them, you can't upgrade your player without them? Think i read that this also happens with the customization items, isn't it? Meaning. As the title says, for 2K19 I’m starting an Online MyLeague on PS4 where I will create a custom player for everyone who joins, based on the descriptions they give me. The goal will be to create them as rookies and play through their entire careers from now until around this time next year, though we can speed things up or slow things down as needed, and hopefully have some fun rivalries and storylines develop between peoples’ players. I’ve done this with a few of my friends for pretty much every. NBA 2K series is a series of basketball sports simulation video games developed and released annually since 1999.
